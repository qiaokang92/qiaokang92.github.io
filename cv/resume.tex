\begin{rSection}{Research Experience}

\item {\bf Performance Clarity for SmartNIC Offloading} \hfill { April 2020 - Present}

Offloading packet processing programs from CPUs to SmartNICs might bring significant performance benefits.
However, the developer has no easy way to understand the offloaded performance beforehand.
We develop Clara to provide performance clarity for SmartNIC offloading.
%We have published a workshop paper in the {\bf HotNets'20 Workshop}.
%Our full paper is in progress.

\item {\bf Automated Attack Discovery in Data plane Systems}    \hfill { May 2019 - Present}

We find a new class of network attacks to the emerging systems that rely on P4 switches.
We propose an approach to discovering attack vectors in these systems in an automated manner.
%We have published a preliminary paper in the {\bf USENIX CSET'19 Workshop}
%and our full conference paper is under review.

\item {\bf Mitigating Network Covert Channels without Performance Loss} \hfill { May 2019 - Nov 2019}

We design and implement a system called NetWarden,
which leverages emerging P4 switches to mitigate network covert channels
while preserving TCP performance.
%Our research paper is published at {\bf USENIX Security'20}, a top-tier conference in Computer Security.

\item {\bf Programmable In-Network Security for BYOD Policies} \hfill { Aug 2018 - Sep 2019}

We present a new security paradigm called programmable in-network security (Poise) for enterprise networks.
Poise enforces access control based on dynamic run-time contexts,
such as the GPS locations of mobile devices.
%Our research paper is published at {\bf USENIX Security'20}, a top-tier conference in Computer Security.
